## ✨ About MysteryMessage

**MysteryMessage** is a modern **Next.js** application focused on anonymous, secure communication. It empowers users to send and receive honest feedback without revealing their identities, fostering openness and trust.

Leveraging the power of **TypeScript** and the flexibility of Next.js, the project emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and performance, making it a robust foundation for future enhancements.

**Note:**
Currently, only Google Sign-In works for creating accounts. The resend email service requires a paid domain to send emails to users, while the free tier only sends emails to the developer’s address. Because of this limitation, email-based signup isn’t fully functional yet. Google authentication is the recommended and fully working option for now.
